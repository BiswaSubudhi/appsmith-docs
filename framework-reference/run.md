# Query

## Run

Each query object contains a run function that is used to execute the query. The run function is asynchronous by nature and can be chained using the callbacks in the function signature.

### Signature

```javascript
run(onSuccess: Function, onError: Function, params: Object): void
```

where **onSuccess** and **onError** are functions and **params** is a dictionary of key-value pairs.

#### Arguments

| Argument Name | Description                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **onSuccess** | The function to be executed when the run method succeeds |
| **onError**   | The function to be executed when the run method fails    |
| **params**    | The additional params to be passed to the run method     |

### Passing Params to Run

Most Queries read values directly from entities as global variables. In some cases such as running a query inside a loop, parameters may need to be passed to the query with values contextual to the execution. This can be achieved using the params argument of the run signature. Please see the example below.

```
Api.run(
() => { showAlert("Success"); }, 
() => { showAlert("Error"); },
{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
);
```

Params sent to a query can be accessed using the `this` keyword

```javascript
{{ this.params.key }}
```

## onSuccess

The onSuccess Function is run when a query is run successfully. The function returns the response of the query and the params passed to it in the callback arguments.

```javascript
onSuccess(response, params): void
```

## onError

The onError Function is run when a query execution fails. The function returns the response of the query and the params passed to it.

```javascript
onError(response, params): void
```

## Data

Each query stores the data from its latest run inside its **data** property. This property is populated only if the query successfully executes and can be accessed as

```javascript
{{ Query1.data }}
```

The data type of this property depends on the data
