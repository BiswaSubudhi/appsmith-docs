## Displaying Data

A Dropdown's **options** can be populated from a data source like an API / Query by transforming the incoming data to an array of (label, value). The transformation can be performed using javascript. So if the data is an array, we can transform it using the [**Array.map**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global\_Objects/TypedArray/map) function.

```javascript
// Query1.data is assumed to be an array here
{{ Query1.data.map((row) => { 
      return { label: row.name, value: row.id } 
   }) 
}}
```

## Filtering Data

A Dropdown can be used to filter a dataset based on the user's input. The selected value can be passed to an API using\*\*`{{ dropdownName.selectedOptionValue }}` .

## **Form Submission**

Dropdown widgets can be used to capture from a fixed set of options inside a form such as gender, role, status.

{% hint style="success" %}
Some forms need to be pre-filled data from a table or API. We can bind the data to the default text property to enable this
{% endhint %}

```
{{ Table1.selectedRow.gender }}
/**
* Binding this to the default option will update the selected option 
* of the dropdown with the gender of the selected row in Table1
*/
```

### Label

The property hosts a group of configurations that you can use to associate a display name and define a placement for the widget. These properties are usually useful when you want to design forms that follow a defined alignment for your form fields and give a professional look to your forms. Below are the properties that you can use:

#### **Text**

It allows you to set the display name for the Select widget. For example, if you want the user to select a Gender Type, you can enter the text as "Gender."&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can leave the text empty if you don't want any display name for your Select widget.
{% endhint %}

#### **Position**

It allows you to specify the placement of the label. You can select one of the available options:

* Top - It allows you to align the text at the top of the Select widget.
* Left - It aligns the text to the left of the Select widget. When you select **Left** alignment, you get additional settings that you can use to control the alignment and define the text's width.
  * Alignment - With the help of alignment, you can define the placement of the text in accordance with the position of the Select widget. You can choose:
    * Left - It aligns the text to the widget's left boundary that is away from the Select widget.
    * Right - It aligns the text closer to the Select widget.
  * Width - With the help of width, you can define the **number of columns** in the **grid** that surrounds the widget. You can specify how close or far the text can be placed to the Select widget.
* Auto - It automatically adjusts the position of the text based on the Select widget's height.

{% hint style="info" %}
Columns are the dashed lines (-----) that surround a widget when you try to drag and drop it on the canvas.
{% endhint %}

## Server-side Filterting
The Select widget has the option to configure server-side filtering, where search queries are sent to the backend, and responses are used to populate options on the Select widget. The video below explains how to configure this.
