7. Enter your username and password to your Redis Database under *Authentication* section.

## Using Redis as a Datasource

### Create keys

Lets create some keys in your Redis Database.

1. After you have added your Datasource, click on **New Query +**.

2. Edit your Query name, from **Query1** to **CreatingKeys**
3. From the *Query* field, create some keys *(Enter one by one)*.

    ```text
    SET DEVELOPER "me"
    ```
    ```test
    SET ENV "DEV"
    ```
    ```text
    SET DATE "Thursday, 7 October, 2021"
    ```

4. Done. We successfully created some keys.

### Fetching Keys

To fetch keys from Redis Database, lets run queries.

1. Again create a new query, and name it as **GetKeys**
2. From the *Query* field, lets fetch our existing keys.
   
    ```text
    GET DEVELOPER
    ```
    Response : me

    ```test
    GET ENV
    ```
    Response : dev

    ```text
    GET DATE
    ```
    Response : Thursday, 7 October, 2021

3. Once you fetch all keys successfully,then you are ready to proceed further.

### Binding the data to a widget

1. After running each query, select your desired **Widget** Type, and click to *Add to canvas*

![Create Widget](../.gitbook/assets/redis-create-widget.png)

2. Now, change the widget name, and its attributes, according to your needs.

3. Done, not that hard right?
