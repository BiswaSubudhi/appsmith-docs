# Single Sign-On(SSO)

Single Sign-On (SSO) is a session and user authentication service that permits users to use one set of login credentials. For example, you can use a single ID(email) to log in to any related or independent software applications.

SSO lets you get your users quickly and securely into your apps, using an authentication system they are already using and trust.

You can configure SSO in Appsmith to use custom authentications. Appsmith provides popular SSO integrations that you can choose from:

## Github OAuth

Github allows the integration of third-party applications using your Github Identity. Follow the guide to customize [Single Sign-On using Github](github-login.md) on Appsmith.

## Google OAuth

Google OAuth integration is one of the most widely used custom authentication integrations. Appsmith allows you to integrate with Google for authenticating users to your apps. Follow the exhaustive guide to configure [Google OAuth as your Single Sign-On Provider](google-login.md).

## OpenID Connect (OIDC)

OpenID Connect(OIDC) is an authentication paradigm built on the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows you to verify the identity of users by authentication provider or your choice. Appsmith is integrated with several authentication providers that you can customize for your self-hosted instances. Follow the step-wise guide to [configure OpenID Connect (OIDC) for Single Sign-On](openid-connect-oidc/).

## Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

**Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)** is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties- an Identity provider(IdP) and a service provider. Appsmith provides integration with SAML providers. You can customize them for your self-hosted instance.
