# Self-signed Certificates

In case your REST endpoint does not support a certificate issued by a CA (Certificate Authority), the REST data source also allows you to upload your self-signed certificate to access the endpoint. This information needs to be provided in PEM format, as shown below. The certificate information is stored in an encrypted format in the database.
